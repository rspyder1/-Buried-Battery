## ⚡ Overview
The Buried Battery is a conceptual power system that leverages the piezoelectric properties of quartz crystals, sandwiched with copper plates, and subjected to extreme pressure underground. The goal is to create a passive, low-maintenance, and self-sustaining energy generator capable of trickle-charging batteries or powering sensors in remote or off-grid environments.

---

## 🧠 Core Concept
- **Piezoelectric Effect**: Quartz generates electrical charge under stress.
- **Material Layout**: Alternating quartz and copper plates stacked in columns.
- **Energy Harvesting**: Earth’s own pressure acts as the stress source.
- **Output**: High voltage, low current — ideal for capacitors or slow charge banks.

## 🏗 Design Summary
- Construct stack of thick quartz and copper plates
- Pre-clamp or pressurize, then bury deep underground
- Use the Earth’s crust as a passive compression field
- Harvest energy via leads connected to copper layers

---

## 🔬 Scientific Foundation
- Quartz piezoelectric behavior is well established
- Earth pressure provides constant mechanical stress
- Potential output scales with size and purity of materials

---

## 💡 Potential Use Cases
- Emergency or survival power nodes
- Seismic activity monitoring
- Remote data relays or backup systems
- Bunker/beacon self-powered installations
